    <h2>Landon's Hobby</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a man of many hobbies. Which one should I write about? I like to read,
      play guitar, sing karaoke, play with my daughter. But one hobby I've been
      involved in for several years is improv comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first exposure to improv comedy was going to a show with my family at
      The Second City in Chicago. I decided soon after to start taking classes
      there to learn the artform. From there, the rest is history.
